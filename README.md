## How did you decide which technologies / Package to use as part of your solution?
we need to see the technologies / package is easy to used and most important it is stable and is already popular,
example why use Next JS because I think this web need to access universal users and if you need to create web apps which is need to good SEO without more config 

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes, we need to improve the UI first for a good User Experience, refactor the code to separate view and action

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I think according to improvements part we need to good UI/UX and more refactor the code
and I need to created the detail of each movie/series on the web
